I plan on spending the next week designing a frontend application with React that uses Twitch.tv's API to host their streaming content. In the next couple weeks I am planning on applying to their company for a frontend engineering position and Tyler mentioned that an app like this would definitely help with the interview process.
Once I have completed the project my goal is to then design clear instructions for my fellow students to try and accomplish the task. If time permits I will also try and create a screen cast of myself building the app.
